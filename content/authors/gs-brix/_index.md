Brix is looking at the ecology of *Sargassum*-dominated communities in the Bolinao, Pangasinan and their responses to environmental changes in the last 30 years. His work is envisioned to provide insights on how to manage these ecologically- and economically-important yet vulnerable resources in light of the current exploitations and environmental changes.
