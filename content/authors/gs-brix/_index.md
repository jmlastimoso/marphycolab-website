Brix will look at the ecology of Sargassum-dominated communities and their responses to changes in sea surface temperatures, particularly in their reproductive seasonalities. His work is envisioned to provide insights on how to manage these ecologically- and economically-important yet vulnerable resources in light of the current exploitations and climatic changes.
