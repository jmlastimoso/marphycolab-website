Hazel is interested in marine biodiversity research. She is expected to work on the diversity and phylogeny of the *Sargassum* resources of Bolinao, Pangasinan. Her work will primarily focus on DNA barcoding of *Sargassum* with the goal of validating species records as well as looking into the phylogenetic relationships of these species within the Order Fucales.
