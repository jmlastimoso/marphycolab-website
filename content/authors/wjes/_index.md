I am interested in exploring our archipelagic coasts in order to discover new taxa and/or validate species records to unravel patterns of (global) marine/seaweed biodiversity. I also enjoy dabbling in seaweeds systematics (particularly classification and nomenclature) and molecular phylogenetics. As part of my commitment to support nation building, I also explore and develop culture technologies for underutilized seaweed species for biomass production. I envision pursuing these lines of basic and applied researches for resources management and to support emerging and existing seaweed industries especially within the tropical Pacific.
