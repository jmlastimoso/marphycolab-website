abstract: 'Morphological and anatomical evidence is presented to support the taxonomic judgment that *Talarodictyon tilesii* Endlicher is conspecific with *Hydroclathrus stephanosorus* Kraft in Kraft & Abbott. Because the former name has nomenclatural priority over the latter name, *Hydroclathrus tilesii* (Endlicher) comb. nov. is proposed.'
