abstract: '*Porphyra marcosii* Cordero is an economically important species considered to be endemic to the northern Philippines. This foliose, monostromatic species with microscopic teeth was first described based on a sample from Dirique Bay, Burgos, Ilocos Norte, in north-western Luzon (Cordero 1976, 15: figs A-H, pl. 1). Together with other foliose Bangiales, *Porphyra marcosii* is locally known as “gamet” and collected from the wild, dried as sheets called “pedazo”, and sold in local markets for consumption as food (Trono & Ganzon-Fortes 1988, Prud’homme van Reine 2001, Cordero 2008). Ogawa (2001) noted the overlap in the morphological characters of *Porphyra marcosii* with the earlier described *Porphyra vietnamensis* Tak.Tanaka & P.H.Hô (Tanaka & Hô 1962), now known as *Phycocalidia vietnamensis* (Tak.Tanaka & P.H.Hô) Santiañez & M.J.Wynne (Santiañez & Wynne 2020). Ogawa (2001) alluded that the two species are conspecific. Prud’homme van Reine (2001) also considered *Porphyra marcosii* as heterotypic synonym of Porphyra vietnamensis. However, Porphyra marcosii is still regarded as distinct by some authors (e.g., Cordero 2008, Monotilla & Notoya 2010, Dumilag & al. 2017, Dumilag & Monotilla 2018).'
