abstract: 'We present here the history and contents of one of the most important herbaria in the Philippines – the Gregorio T. Velasquez Phycological Herbarium of the Marine Science Institute (MSI) at the University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman. The MSI herbarium was established in the early 1970s by Dr. Gavino C. Trono Jr. and was named in honor of his mentor Dr. Gregorio T. Velasquez, the “Father of Philippine Phycology.” Collections in the MSI herbarium are primarily made by Filipino phycologists within the coasts and offshore islands and reefs of the Philippines. The MSI herbarium currently holds ~ 55,000 algal and seagrass specimens collected from various areas in the country and abroad. As the largest repository of marine plants in the Philippines and the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) region, we consider the MSI herbarium as both a legacy and national heritage that we owe to the pillars of Philippine phycology – Dr. Gavino C. Trono Jr. and the late Dr. Gregorio T. Velasquez.'
