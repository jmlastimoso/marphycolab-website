abstract: 'Recent taxonomic and molecular phylogenetic studies by McDevit & Saunders (2017) of Canadian Scytosiphonaceae resulted to the description of the new genus *Planosiphon* McDevit & G.W.Saunders and a new species *Scytosiphon promiscuus* McDevit & G.W.Saunders. The proposal of the new genus was made to accommodate a highly supported clade consisting of species of *Scytosiphon* and *Petalonia* with flattened thalli that are hollow to partially hollow. Typically, *Planosiphon* species also lack paraphyses (ascocysts) amongst their uniseriate plurangia (McDevit and Saunders 2017). Together with the discovery of a new monotypic genus *Tronoella* Santiañez & Kogame (Santiañez et al. in press), the description of *Planosiphon* increases the number of genera in the family Scytosiphonaceae to 12. Comparing the morphologies and life histories of taxa that are closely related to *Planosiphon* suggested that the genus can be further defined through the life histories in culture of its members. In particular, *Planosiphon* species have been reported to have *Compsonema*-like prostrate sporophytic thalli that bear only unangia [unilocular sporangia] (Kogame and Kawai 1993, Kogame 1998, Kogame et al. 1999).'
