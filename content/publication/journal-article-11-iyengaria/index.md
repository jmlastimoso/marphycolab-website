abstract: The taxonomy, classification, and phylogenetic relationships of the brown seaweed genus *Iyengaria* with other members of the family Scytosiphonaceae remain poorly understood. In this study, we addressed some problems in the systematics (taxonomic and classification status) and phylogenetic position of *Iyengaria* based on our studies on the generitype *Iyengaria stellata* from Kuwait and South Africa. We confirm that *I. stellata* is conspecific with *Colpomenia capensis* based on molecular and morpho-anatomical data and that the species has a disjunct distribution within the Indian Ocean. Also, the distinguishing features of two *Iyengaria* species (*I. nizamuddinii* and ‘*I. lobocylindrica*’) described from Karachi, Pakistan, are within the morphological range of *I. stellata*. Hence, these two taxa are considered here as junior heterotypic synonyms of *I. stellata*. Our molecular phylogenetic analyses suggested the paraphyly of the genus *Iyengaria*, with the recently described *Iyengaria quadriseriata* from India forming close associations with *Rosenvingea intricata*. As such, we remove *I. quadriseriata* from the genus *Iyengaria* and relegate it as a synonym of *R. intricata*. Consequently, by recognizing only one species, our proposals considerably reduce the species diversity in the genus. Moreover, our culture studies suggested that *I. stellata* exhibits an alternation of heteromorphic generations, similar to other species in the Scytosiphonaceae. Under culture conditions, *I. stellata* also produced plurangia on microthalli, confirming its affinity with other phylogenetically close relatives in the ‘*Hydroclathrus* group’ of the family Scytosiphonaceae such as *Colpomenia*, *Rosenvingea*, and *Chnoospora*.
