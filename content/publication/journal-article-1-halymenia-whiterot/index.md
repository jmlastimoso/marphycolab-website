abstract: 'We report herein for the first time the occurrence of a white rot disease and heavy infestation of epiphytes on the cultured red seaweed *Halymenia durvillei* in Bolinao, Pangasinan. White rot disease causes tissues to decay, weakens the affected branches, resulting in the breakage of thalli and loss of biomass. The cause of the white rot disease on *H. durvillei* remains unknown but may be associated with pathogenic microorganisms similar to other reported cases of diseases among cultured seaweeds. The infestation of the epiphytic alga we identified as *Neosiphonia apiculata* has detrimental effects on the tank-cultured *Halymenia durvillei*, where much of the thalli exhibited stunted growth. We hypothesized that the unfavorable environmental conditions preceding the infestation may have triggered the uncontrolled proliferation of the epiphytes on the cultured *H. durvillei*.'
