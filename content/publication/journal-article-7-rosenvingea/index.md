abstract: We describe herein the morpho-anatomy of the elusive brown alga *Rosenvingea nhatrangensis* (Scytosiphonaceae, Phaeophyceae) and add this species to the flora of both the Philippines and Malaysia. At present, only two *Rosenvingea* species (*R. intricata* and *R. orientalis*) have been reported from both localities. We also report on the occurrence of *R. australis* in central Philippines based on molecular phylogenetic data, thus extending its distribution to the northern Pacific. First time account of the morphology of *R. australis* sporophyte under culture conditions is also provided.
