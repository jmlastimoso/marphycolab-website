abstract: The brown algal family Scytosiphonaceae has recently received considerable attention resulting in the description of several new genera and species. However, members of the genus *Scytosiphon* and *Petalonia* remain polyphyletic. By integrating multi-gene phylogenetic data (mitochondrial cox3 and plastid psaA and rbcL genes) with their known morpho-anatomies and life histories, we herein resurrect *Hapterophycus canaliculatus*, currently considered a member of genus *Scytosiphon*, and transfer *Scytosiphon* tenellus to the genus *Petalonia*.
