abstract: 'A new and putatively endemic species of *Hydroclathrus*, *Hydroclathrus rapanuii*, is described from the geographically isolated Easter Island in the southeastern Pacific based on morphological and molecular phylogenetic data. It is distinguished from other *Hydroclathrus* by thalli of unevenly furrowed thin membranes, and angular, block-like plurangial sori. Our phylogenetic analyses indicated that *H. rapanuii* is closely related to the generitype *Hydroclathrus clathratus*. We also report on the morphology and phylogeny of *Chnoospora minima* from Easter I. and elsewhere in the Indo-Pacific Ocean, noting the previously unreported presence of hollow portions in its medulla. Although not collected from Easter I., we herein propose the recognition of two new genera, *Dactylosiphon* gen. nov. and *Pseudochnoospora* gen. nov., based on our three-gene phylogeny and their known morphologies and anatomies. *Dactylosiphon* is based on the three species currently assigned to *Colpomenia* (*C. bullosa*, *C. durvillei*, and *C. wynnei*) that are genetically and morphologically (i.e. thalli with erect and finger-like tubes arising from a common saccate base) distinct from other members of *Colpomenia*. The monotypic genus *Pseudochnoospora* is represented by the decumbent, branching, and inter-adhesive species currently known as *Chnoospora implexa*. With the above proposals, we further increase the genus-level diversity of Scytosiphonaceae in the Indo-Pacific Ocean.'

summary: '*Hydroclathrus rapanuii* sp. nov. is newly described from Easter Island and the morpho-anatomy of *Chnoospora minima* is also redefined. Based on integrative approaches, new scytosiphonacean genera (i.e., *Dactylosiphon* gen. nov. and *Pseudochnoospora* gen. nov.) were also newly established.'
