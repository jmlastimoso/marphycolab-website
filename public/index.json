The proposal of the new genus was made to accommodate a highly supported clade consisting of species of *Scytosiphon* and *Petalonia* with flattened thalli that are hollow to partially hollow. Typically, *Planosiphon* species also lack paraphyses (ascocysts) amongst their uniseriate plurangia (McDevit and Saunders 2017). Together with the discovery of a new monotypic genus *Tronoella* Santiañez \u0026 Kogame (Santiañez et al. in press), the description of *Planosiphon* increases the number of genera in the family Scytosiphonaceae to 12. Comparing the morphologies and life histories of taxa that are closely related to *Planosiphon* suggested that the genus can be further defined through the life histories in culture of its members. In particular, *Planosiphon* species have been reported to have *Compsonema*-like prostrate sporophytic thalli that bear only unangia [unilocular sporangia] (Kogame and Kawai 1993, Kogame 1998, Kogame et al. 1999).","tags":["Seaweed systematics"],"title":"Transfer of Petalonia filiformis (Batters) Kuntze to the genus Planosiphon McDevit \u0026 G.W.Saunders (Scytosiphonaceae, Phaeophyceae)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wilfred John E.

White rot disease causes tissues to decay, weakens the affected branches, resulting in the breakage of thalli and loss of biomass. The cause of the white rot disease on *H. durvillei* remains unknown but may be associated with pathogenic microorganisms similar to other reported cases of diseases among cultured seaweeds. The infestation of the epiphytic alga we identified as *Neosiphonia apiculata* has detrimental effects on the tank-cultured *Halymenia durvillei*, where much of the thalli exhibited stunted growth. We hypothesized that the unfavorable environmental conditions preceding the infestation may have triggered the uncontrolled proliferation of the epiphytes on the cultured *H. durvillei*.","tags":["Seaweed culture","Seaweed disease"],"title":"White rot disease and epiphytism on Halymenia durvillei Bory de Saint-Vincent (Halymeniaceae, Rhodophyta) in culture","type":"publication"}]
