      <description>&lt;p&gt;Steffi plans to explore the diversity and phylogeny of some members of the Order Dictyotales (e.g., fan-like and calcifying species of the genus Padina) that are found in the Bolinao-Anda reef complex, Pangasinan.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Eunize works on the diversity and molecular phylogeny of brown seaweeds under the Order Dictyotales. She expects to describe new species and/or report new records of seaweeds from the genus &lt;em&gt;Dictyota&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lobophora&lt;/em&gt;, among others. Her work focuses on taxa found in northwestern Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dana seeks to contribute to the understanding of the life history and reproduction of tropical species of green seaweeds &lt;em&gt;Ulva&lt;/em&gt;. Her work is expected to complement our current efforts towards developing a local technologies for mass cultivation of &lt;em&gt;Ulva&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kim intends to unravel the diversity of calcifying and coenocytic green seaweeds under the genus &lt;em&gt;Halimeda&lt;/em&gt;. In order to accomplish his objective, he will use an integrative approach to species delineation combining information derived from molecular sequences and geometric morphometric analyses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hazel is interested in marine biodiversity research. She is expected to work on the diversity and phylogeny of the &lt;em&gt;Sargassum&lt;/em&gt; resources of Bolinao, Pangasinan. Her work will primarily focus on DNA barcoding of &lt;em&gt;Sargassum&lt;/em&gt; with the goal of validating species records as well as looking into the phylogenetic relationships of these species within the Order Fucales.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Brix will look at the ecology of Sargassum-dominated communities and their responses to changes in sea surface temperatures, particularly in their reproductive seasonalities. His work is envisioned to provide insights on how to manage these ecologically- and economically-important yet vulnerable resources in light of the current exploitations and climatic changes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am interested in exploring our archipelagic coasts in order to discover new taxa and/or validate species records to unravel patterns of (global) marine/seaweed biodiversity. I also enjoy dabbling in seaweeds systematics (particularly classification and nomenclature) and molecular phylogenetics. As part of my commitment to support nation building, I also explore and develop culture technologies for underutilized seaweed species for biomass production. I envision pursuing these lines of basic and applied researches for resources management and to support emerging and existing seaweed industries especially within the tropical Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We actively work on the biology of seaweeds, especially their biodiversity, systematics, life history, and reproduction. We also dabble on algal community ecology, gravitating towards understanding the ecology of canopy-forming seaweeds such as &lt;em&gt;Sargassum&lt;/em&gt;. Other researches done by our team include floristics, marine phytogeography, and molecular phylogenetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, we conduct applied phycological researches, with special reference to seaweed farming (i.e., mass cultivation of carrageenan-producing seaweeds &lt;em&gt;Kappaphycus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Eucheuma&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Halymenia&lt;/em&gt;). Currently, we are scaling up on our efforts in harnessing underutilized seaweed resources by developing novel and/or locally-adapted cultivation technologies for large-scale biomass production. This is to support the call of the seaweed industry to diversify our seaweed products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team of young, budding scientists is led by one of the newest additions to the roster of faculty of MSI, &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Wilfred John E. Santiañez&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ace works part-time as a laboratory technician collecting for and maintaining our reference seaweed culture collections. He works full-time under at the Seaweed Biodiversity and Culture Laboratory of National Scientist Gavino C. Trono Jr., assisting in field sampling, species identification, and herbarium specimen preparations, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
