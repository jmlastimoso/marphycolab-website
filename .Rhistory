abstract: 'In their most recent study on the economically important and speciose genus *Pyropia* J.Agardh, Yang *et al*. (2020) made considerable changes in the taxonomy and classification of the group by redefining *Pyropia*, describing four new genera (viz, *Calidia* L.-E.Yang & J.Brodie, *Neoporphyra* J.Brodie & L.-E.Yang, *Neopyropia* J.Brodie & L.-E.Yang, and *Uedaea* J.Brodie & L.-E.Yang), and taxonomically reinstating *Porphyrella* G.M.Smith & Hollenberg with an emended description. The genus *Calidia* was described using both morphological and molecular characters, based on the new species *Calidia pseudolobata* L.-E.Yang,  J.Brodie & Q.-Q.Lu (Yang *et al*. 2020). Unfortunately, that genus name is illegitimate, being a later homonym of *Calidia* J.Stirton in King *et al*. (1876), a genus of lichens that is presently considered to be a later taxonomic synonym of *Byssoloma* Trevisan, 1853 (James, 1971).  We here propose a new genus name to replace the red algal genus *Calidia* L.-E.Yang & J.Brodie, as well as transfer species that had been assigned to this segregate genus.'

abstract: 'In their most recent study on the economically important and speciose genus *Pyropia* J.Agardh, Yang *et al*. (2020) made considerable changes in the taxonomy and classification of the group by redefining *Pyropia*, describing four new genera (viz, *Calidia* L.-E.Yang & J.Brodie, *Neoporphyra* J.Brodie & L.-E.Yang, *Neopyropia* J.Brodie & L.-E.Yang, and *Uedaea* J.Brodie & L.-E.Yang), and taxonomically reinstating *Porphyrella* G.M.Smith & Hollenberg with an emended description. The genus *Calidia* was described using both morphological and molecular characters, based on the new species *Calidia pseudolobata* L.-E.Yang,  J.Brodie & Q.-Q.Lu (Yang *et al*. 2020). Unfortunately, that genus name is illegitimate, being a later homonym of *Calidia* J.Stirton in King *et al*. (1876), a genus of lichens that is presently considered to be a later taxonomic synonym of *Byssoloma* Trevisan, 1853 (James, 1971).  We here propose a new genus name to replace the red algal genus *Calidia* L.-E.Yang & J.Brodie, as well as transfer species that had been assigned to this segregate genus.'
